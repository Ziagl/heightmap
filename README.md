# heightmap
A simple console programm to create a random heightmap based on different algorithms.

Following algotihms can be used to create an initial heightmap:

Fractal algorithms
1. triangle division
2. diamond-square
3. midpoint disblacement

procedural algorithms
4. fault formation
5. particle deposition
6. perlin noise
7. voronoi diagram

additional you can use erosion algorithms to simulate heightmap erosion overt time.

Source code is available and testet for Windows and Linux, also Sample Data are added for heightmap textures.

Generated heightmaps can be used for games or simulations.

How To:

just comile source code and put data folder in the same directory as generated heightmap binary.

Tested on Windows (Visual Studio) and Linux (CodeLite)
